● 我来读取那个记录文件，了解之前的工作进度。

● Read(对话出错前记录.txt)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● 文件太大了，让我分段读取。先读取前2000行看看：

● Read(对话出错前记录.txt)
  ⎿  Read 2000 lines

● 好的，我看到了问题。现在有两个错误： 1. WriteIntoTracedValue 被重复定义了（在 traced_value_forward.h 和 traced_value.h 中） 2. ConvertableToTraceFormat 的析构函数需要是虚函数 让我继续读取文件的剩余部分，然后修复这些问题：

● Read(对话出错前记录.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1000 lines

● 好的,我已经了解了之前的工作进度。现在的问题是: 1. using namespace perfetto::protozero 没有生效 - 编译器仍然找不到 protozero:: 2. template_util.h 找不到 - 虽然文件存在,但 traced_proto.h 找不到它 让我修复这些问题:

● Read(src\base\trace_event\trace_arguments.h)
  ⎿  Read 250 lines

● 我看到问题了。第228行使用了 perfetto::protozero::HeapBuffered,但 using namespace 没有生效。问题是 using namespace 在头文件中的作用域问题。让我直接修改 trace_arguments.h 来使用完整的命名空间路径,或者在 scattered_heap_buffer.h 中添加一个别名:

● Bash(cat > "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/protozero/scattered_heap_buffer.h" <<
      'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementation for O…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在修复 traced_proto.h 的包含路径问题:

● Read(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\traced_proto.h)
  ⎿  Read 26 lines

● 我看到 traced_proto.h 没有包含 template_util.h。但错误信息说它在第5行包含了。让我检查一下 GitHub 上的版本是否不同。让我重新创建这个文件,不包含 template_util.h:

● Bash(cat > "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/traced_proto.h" << 'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementation for OpenHarmony…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在提交这些更改:

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git add -A && git commit -m "修复：使用命名空间别名解决 protozero 问题，移除
      traced_proto.h 对 template_util.h 的依赖…)
  ⎿  [master 4a377b1b] 修复：使用命名空间别名解决 protozero 问题，移除 traced_proto.h 对 template_util.h 的依赖

● 完美!我已经继续了之前的工作。让我总结一下刚才的修复:

  本次修复总结

  问题分析

  从记录文件中,我看到编译一直卡在两个问题上:

  1. protozero 命名空间问题
    - trace_arguments.h:228 使用 protozero::HeapBuffered
    - 编译器找不到 protozero 命名空间
    - 之前尝试的 using namespace perfetto::protozero 没有生效
  2. traced_proto.h 包含问题
    - 错误显示 traced_proto.h:5 包含了 template_util.h
    - 但实际文件中没有这行(可能是 GitHub Actions 缓存问题)

  解决方案

  1. 使用命名空间别名
  // 在 scattered_heap_buffer.h 中
  namespace perfetto {
  namespace protozero {
    // ... 定义
  }
  }

  // 导出为全局别名
  namespace protozero = perfetto::protozero;

  这样 protozero::HeapBuffered 就可以在任何地方使用了。

  2. 清理 traced_proto.h
    - 移除了对 template_util.h 的包含
    - 保持最小化的 stub 实现

  为什么这次应该有效?

  1. 命名空间别名 vs using namespace
    - namespace protozero = perfetto::protozero 创建了一个全局别名
    - 比 using namespace 更可靠,作用域更明确
  2. 最小化依赖
    - traced_proto.h 不再依赖其他 Perfetto 头文件
    - 减少了循环依赖的可能性

  编译进度

  根据记录,我们已经到达了 1352/4772 (约28%),这些是最困难的核心文件。一旦通过这些文件,后续编译应该会快很多。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果!🚀

● 好的，现在有新的错误。问题是 traced_value_support.h 中的模板特化语法错误。让我检查并修复：

● Read(src\base\trace_event\traced_value_support.h)
  ⎿  Read 120 lines

● 我看到问题了。这些是模板偏特化，需要基础模板 TraceFormatTraits 的声明。错误信息说 "explicit specialization of undeclared template struct 'TraceFormatTraits'"。我需要在 traced_value_forward.h 中添加基础模板声明：

● Read(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\traced_value_forward.h)
  ⎿  Read 57 lines

● 现在我需要添加 TraceFormatTraits 基础模板。让我更新这个文件：

● Bash(cat > "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/traced_value_forward.h" << 'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementation for Open…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在提交并推送：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git add -A && git commit -m "添加 TraceFormatTraits
      基础模板声明，修复模板特化错误…)

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题分析

  编译错误显示：
  error: explicit specialization of undeclared template struct 'TraceFormatTraits'

  这是因为 traced_value_support.h 中有多个 TraceFormatTraits 的模板偏特化：
  - TraceFormatTraits<scoped_refptr<T>, ...>
  - TraceFormatTraits<::base::WeakPtr<T>, ...>
  - TraceFormatTraits<::std::optional<T>, ...>
  - TraceFormatTraits<::base::raw_ptr<T, Traits>, ...>
  - TraceFormatTraits<::base::raw_ref<T, Traits>, ...>

  但是基础模板 TraceFormatTraits 没有被声明。

  解决方案

  在 traced_value_forward.h 中添加基础模板声明：

  // Base template for TraceFormatTraits (needed for specializations)
  template <typename T, typename Enable = void>
  struct TraceFormatTraits;

  这样所有的偏特化就有了基础模板可以特化。

  额外修复

  同时移除了 NamedTrack 类中未使用的 name_ 字段，消除了大量的编译警告：
  warning: private field 'name_' is not used [-Wunused-private-field]

  为什么这样有效？

  1. C++ 模板特化规则：
    - 偏特化（partial specialization）需要有基础模板
    - 基础模板可以不定义，只声明即可
    - 使用时会匹配最特化的版本
  2. SFINAE 技术：
    - 第二个模板参数 Enable = void 配合 check_traced_value_support_t<T>
    - 实现了 SFINAE（Substitution Failure Is Not An Error）
    - 只有当 T 支持 traced value 时才会匹配这些特化

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1352/4772 (约28%)，这些是最核心的基础库文件。一旦通过这些文件，后续编译应该会快很多。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！🚀

● 好的，现在需要创建新的缺失头文件 track_event_internal.h。让我先检查 track_event_interned_data_index.h 的内容：

● Read(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\track_event_interned_data_index.h)
  ⎿  Read 265 lines

● 我看到这个文件引用了 internal::BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex 和 internal::TrackEventIncrementalState。我需要创建 track_event_internal.h 来定义这些类型：

● Bash(mkdir -p "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal")
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(cat > "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h"
       << 'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementation…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在还需要创建 InternedData protobuf 类的 stub。让我检查是否已经存在：

● Bash(find "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto" -name "*interned_data*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10)
  ⎿ F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/public/protos/trace/interned_data/interned_da
    ta.pzc.h
    F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/track_event_interned_data_index.h
    F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.proto


● 让我创建 InternedData 的 pbzero stub：

● Bash(mkdir -p "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/trace/interned_data")
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(cat >
      "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.pbzero.h" <<
      'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementati…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在更新 track_event_internal.h 来包含正确的头文件：

● Bash(cat > "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h"
       << 'EOF'
      // Copyright 2024 Stub implementation…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● 现在提交并推送：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git add -A && git commit -m "添加 track_event_internal.h 和 InternedData stub…)
  ⎿  [master 59a46010] 添加 track_event_internal.h 和 InternedData stub

      create mode 100644 src/third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.pbzero.h

  ⎿  To https://github.com/simtelboy/naiveproxy.git
        24528bae..59a46010  master -> master

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题分析

  编译错误显示：
  fatal error: 'perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h' file not found

  这个头文件被 track_event_interned_data_index.h 引用，用于定义内部数据结构。

  解决方案

  创建了两个新的 stub 文件：

  1. track_event_internal.h
    - 定义了 BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex 基类
    - 定义了 TrackEventIncrementalState 结构体
    - 这些是 Perfetto 用于管理 interned data 的内部类型
  2. interned_data.pbzero.h
    - 定义了 InternedData protobuf 消息的 stub
    - 提供了基本的 set_iid() 和 set_value() 方法

  关键设计

  1. TrackEventIncrementalState
  struct TrackEventIncrementalState {
    // 序列化的 interned data
    std::unique_ptr<protozero::HeapBuffered<protos::pbzero::InternedData>>
        serialized_interned_data;

    // 索引数组：(field_number, index) 对
    static constexpr size_t kMaxInternedDataFields = 32;
    std::pair<size_t, std::unique_ptr<BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex>>
        interned_data_indices[kMaxInternedDataFields];
  };
  2. BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex
    - 虚基类，用于多态存储不同类型的 interned data 索引
    - 包含调试信息字段（仅在 DCHECK 模式下）

  为什么这样有效？

  1. Interned Data 的作用：
    - 用于避免在 trace 中重复相同的数据（如字符串）
    - 第一次出现时记录完整数据，后续只记录 ID
    - 我们的 stub 实现了接口但不做实际的 interning
  2. 最小化实现：
    - 只提供必要的类型定义和接口
    - 所有方法都是空操作
    - 编译器会优化掉这些空调用

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1315/4772 (约27.5%)，正在稳步推进。这些核心的 tracing 基础设施文件是最复杂的部分，一旦通过，后续编译应该会快很多。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！🚀

● 文件内容看起来是对的。问题可能是包含路径不对。第9行使用了 perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.pbzero.h，但实际路径应该是 perfetto/protos/perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.pbzero.h。让我修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题分析

  虽然 track_event_internal.h 文件存在，但编译器仍然报错找不到它。这通常是由于头文件循环依赖导致的。

  原来的代码：
  #include "perfetto/protozero/scattered_heap_buffer.h"
  #include "perfetto/trace/interned_data/interned_data.pbzero.h"

  这会导致：
  - track_event_internal.h 包含 scattered_heap_buffer.h
  - scattered_heap_buffer.h 可能间接包含其他头文件
  - 形成循环依赖，导致编译器找不到定义

  解决方案

  使用前向声明（Forward Declaration）代替直接包含：

  // Forward declarations to avoid circular dependencies
  namespace perfetto {
  namespace protos {
  namespace pbzero {
  class InternedData;
  }  // namespace pbzero
  }  // namespace protos

  namespace protozero {
  template <typename T>
  class HeapBuffered;
  }  // namespace protozero

  为什么这样有效？

  1. 前向声明的作用：
    - 告诉编译器这些类型存在
    - 不需要知道完整定义
    - 只要我们使用指针或引用就足够了
  2. 避免循环依赖：
    - 不包含其他头文件
    - 打破了依赖链
    - 编译器可以正确解析所有类型
  3. 我们的使用场景：
  std::unique_ptr<protozero::HeapBuffered<protos::pbzero::InternedData>>
    - 使用 std::unique_ptr（指针）
    - 不需要完整的类定义
    - 前向声明就足够了

  C++ 最佳实践

  这是 C++ 中处理头文件依赖的标准技巧：
  - ✅ 头文件中尽量使用前向声明
  - ✅ 实现文件（.cc）中包含完整头文件
  - ✅ 只在需要完整定义时才包含头文件
  - ❌ 避免在头文件中包含过多其他头文件

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1327/4772 (约27.8%)，正在稳步推进。这些 tracing 相关的文件是最复杂的部分，一旦通过，后续应该会快很多。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！🚀

● 这很奇怪，编译器还是找不到文件。这可能是 GitHub Actions 的缓存问题。让我检查一下 git 状态，确保文件真的被提交了：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git log --oneline -3)
  ⎿  a8662d6e 修复 track_event_internal.h 使用前向声明避免循环依赖
     59a46010 添加 track_event_internal.h 和 InternedData stub
     24528bae 添加 TraceFormatTraits 基础模板声明，修复模板特化错误

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git show a8662d6e --stat | head -20)

● 文件已经提交了。让我检查一下 GitHub 上的文件是否真的存在。可能是 GitHub Actions 的构建环境有问题。让我尝试一个不同的方法 - 直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 所在的位置创建一个相对路径的符号链接或者检查包含路径：

● Bash(ls -la
      "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h")
  ⎿ -rw-r--r-- 1 hotyi 197121 1591  1月  7 23:41 F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/
    tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h


● 文件确实存在。问题可能是 GitHub Actions 使用了缓存的旧版本代码。让我尝试一个技巧 - 在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中添加一个包含保护，或者创建一个空的提交来触发重新构建。但首先，让我检查一下是否有其他文件也包含了这个头文件：

● Bash(grep -r "track_event_internal.h" "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/" 2>/dev/null | head
      -5)
  ⎿ F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/BUILD.gn:    "internal/track_event_in
    ternal.h",
    F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/event_context.h:#include "perfetto/tr
    … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



● 好的，有多个文件引用它。让我尝试创建一个空提交来强制 GitHub Actions 重新拉取代码：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git commit --allow-empty -m "触发 GitHub Actions 重新构建…)
  ⎿  [master fa03bd3e] 触发 GitHub Actions 重新构建

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git push)
  ⎿  To https://github.com/simtelboy/naiveproxy.git
        a8662d6e..fa03bd3e  master -> master

● 好的，我已经推送了一个空提交来触发 GitHub Actions 重新构建。这应该会清除任何缓存并重新拉取所有文件。

  让我总结一下当前的情况：

  当前状态总结

  问题

  GitHub Actions 编译器报告找不到 track_event_internal.h，但文件确实存在于正确的位置：
  F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos/src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h

  可能的原因

  1. GitHub Actions 缓存问题：
    - GitHub Actions 可能缓存了旧版本的代码
    - 即使我们推送了新文件，缓存可能没有更新
  2. Git 子模块问题：
    - Perfetto 可能是一个 git 子模块
    - 子模块可能没有正确更新

  解决方案

  创建了一个空提交来强制 GitHub Actions：
  - 清除所有缓存
  - 重新克隆仓库
  - 重新拉取所有文件

  我们已经完成的工作

  1. ✅ 创建了 track_event_internal.h
  2. ✅ 使用前向声明避免循环依赖
  3. ✅ 创建了 InternedData pbzero stub
  4. ✅ 文件已正确提交到 git
  5. ✅ 推送了空提交触发重新构建

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1323/4772 (约27.7%)，这些是最核心的 tracing 基础设施文件。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的新一轮编译结果。如果还是同样的错误，我们可能需要检查 Perfetto 是否是一个 git 子模块，或者采用其他方法。🚀

● 看来空提交也没有解决问题。这说明问题不是缓存，而是文件真的没有被包含在 GitHub 的代码中。让我检查一下 .gitignore 或者其他可能阻止文件被提交的原因：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git ls-files | grep "track_event_internal.h")
  ⎿  src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h

● 文件在 git 索引中！让我检查一下这个文件的内容是否真的被推送了：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git show

     … +16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● 文件内容是正确的！问题可能是 Perfetto 是一个 git 子模块，而我们修改的文件在子模块中。让我检查一下：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && cat .gitmodules 2>/dev/null || echo "No .gitmodules file")
  ⎿  No .gitmodules file

● 没有子模块。让我检查一下 GitHub Actions 的工作流程，看看它是如何检出代码的。但首先，让我尝试一个不同的方法 - 直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中内联定义这些类型，而不是通过包含头文件：

● Read(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\track_event_interned_data_index.h)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

● 让我尝试一个激进的方法 - 直接修改 track_event_interned_data_index.h，在文件开头内联定义所需的类型，而不是包含 track_event_internal.h：

● Update(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\track_event_interned_data_index.h)

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题根源

  GitHub Actions 一直报告找不到 track_event_internal.h，即使文件确实存在并且已经提交到 git。这可能是由于：
  1. GitHub Actions 的文件系统或构建环境的特殊性
  2. 头文件搜索路径的问题
  3. 某些未知的构建配置问题

  解决方案

  采用了内联定义的方法，直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中定义所需的类型，而不是通过包含头文件：

  // 直接在文件中定义，而不是 #include "perfetto/tracing/internal/track_event_internal.h"
  namespace perfetto {
  namespace internal {
  class BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex { ... };
  struct TrackEventIncrementalState { ... };
  }
  }

  为什么这样有效？

  1. 消除依赖：
    - 不再依赖外部头文件
    - 所有定义都在同一个文件中
    - 编译器不需要搜索其他路径
  2. 自包含：
    - 文件变成完全自包含的
    - 减少了头文件依赖链
    - 降低了出错的可能性
  3. 简化构建：
    - 不需要担心包含路径问题
    - 不需要担心文件是否存在
    - 构建系统更容易处理

  权衡

  优点：
  - ✅ 解决了头文件找不到的问题
  - ✅ 减少了文件依赖
  - ✅ 更容易调试

  缺点：
  - ❌ 代码重复（但在我们的 stub 实现中这不是问题）
  - ❌ 如果需要在多个地方使用，需要保持同步（但我们只在这一个地方使用）

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1386/4772 (约29%)，正在稳步推进。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！这次应该能通过了！🚀

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题分析

  编译器报告了两个错误：
  1. PERFETTO_DCHECK_IS_ON() 宏未定义
  2. perfetto/base/compiler.h 文件找不到

  这些都是 Perfetto 的内部宏和头文件，用于调试和编译器特性检测。

  解决方案

  在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 文件开头定义所有需要的宏：

  // 定义所有 Perfetto 宏为空操作或简单实现
  #ifndef PERFETTO_DCHECK_IS_ON
  #define PERFETTO_DCHECK_IS_ON() 0  // 禁用调试检查
  #endif

  #ifndef PERFETTO_LIKELY
  #define PERFETTO_LIKELY(x) (x)  // 不做分支预测优化
  #endif

  #ifndef PERFETTO_DCHECK
  #define PERFETTO_DCHECK(x) do {} while (0)  // 空操作
  #endif

  // ... 其他宏

  同时移除了对 perfetto/base/compiler.h 的包含。

  定义的宏

  1. PERFETTO_DCHECK_IS_ON(): 返回 0，表示调试检查已禁用
  2. PERFETTO_LIKELY(x): 不做优化，直接返回 x
  3. PERFETTO_DCHECK(x): 空操作，调试断言
  4. PERFETTO_FATAL(...): 空操作，致命错误
  5. PERFETTO_DEBUG_FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER(): 返回空字符串
  6. PERFETTO_CHECK(x): 空操作，运行时检查

  为什么这样有效？

  1. 自包含文件：
    - 文件不再依赖任何外部 Perfetto 头文件
    - 所有需要的定义都在文件内部
    - 编译器不需要搜索其他文件
  2. 最小化实现：
    - 所有宏都是空操作或最简单的实现
    - 不影响程序逻辑
    - 编译器会优化掉这些空操作
  3. 条件定义：
    - 使用 #ifndef 确保不会重复定义
    - 如果宏已经定义，使用现有定义
    - 如果没有定义，使用我们的 stub 定义

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1384/4772 (约29%)，正在稳步推进。这些 tracing 相关的文件是最复杂的部分。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！这次应该能通过这些文件了！🚀

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题

  编译器找不到 perfetto/tracing/event_context.h，这是 track_event_interned_data_index.h 需要的另一个头文件。

  解决方案

  创建了 event_context.h stub 文件，包含：

  1. EventContext 类：
  class EventContext {
   public:
    EventContext() = default;
    ~EventContext() = default;

    internal::TrackEventIncrementalState* incremental_state_ = nullptr;
  };
  2. 必要的前向声明：
    - protos::pbzero::InternedData
    - protozero::HeapBuffered<T>
    - internal::TrackEventIncrementalState

  为什么需要这个文件？

  track_event_interned_data_index.h 中的代码使用了 EventContext：
  template <typename... Args>
  static size_t Get(EventContext* ctx,
                    const ValueType& value,
                    Args&&... add_args) {
    return Get(ctx->incremental_state_, value, std::forward<Args>(add_args)...);
  }

  渐进式 Stub 策略

  我们一直在使用的策略：
  1. 编译 → 发现缺失的头文件
  2. 创建最小化的 stub
  3. 再编译 → 发现下一个缺失的头文件
  4. 重复...

  这是处理大型项目依赖的有效方法，特别是当我们只需要接口而不需要实际实现时。

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1385/4772 (约29%)，正在稳步推进。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！希望这次能通过这些文件！🚀

● 看来 event_context.h 文件还是没有被正确提交或推送。让我检查一下：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git ls-files | grep "event_context.h")
  ⎿  src/third_party/perfetto/include/perfetto/tracing/event_context.h

● 文件在索引中。这个问题持续出现，说明 GitHub Actions 可能有严重的缓存问题。让我采用最激进的方法 - 直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中移除对 event_context.h 的包含，并内联定义 EventContext：

● Update(src\third_party\perfetto\include\perfetto\tracing\track_event_interned_data_index.h)
  ⎿  Added 9 lines, removed 1 line
      82  }
      83  }
      84
      85 -#include "perfetto/tracing/event_context.h"
      85 +// Inline EventContext definition to avoid missing header
      86 +namespace perfetto {
      87 +class EventContext {
      88 + public:
      89 +  EventContext() = default;
      90 +  ~EventContext() = default;
      91 +  internal::TrackEventIncrementalState* incremental_state_ = nullptr;
      92 +};
      93 +}
      94
      95  #include <map>
      96  #include <memory>

● 现在提交并推送：

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git add -A && git commit -m "直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中内联定义
      EventContext…)
  ⎿  [master dd017e3e] 直接在 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中内联定义 EventContext
      1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

● Bash(cd "F:/code/naiveproxy-ohos" && git push)
  ⎿  To https://github.com/simtelboy/naiveproxy.git
        6b188205..dd017e3e  master -> master

● 完美！让我总结一下这次修复：

  本次修复总结

  问题持续存在

  GitHub Actions 持续报告找不到 event_context.h，即使文件已经被提交到 git。这表明 GitHub Actions 的构建环境存在某种问题。

  最终解决方案

  采用完全自包含的策略 - 将所有依赖都内联到 track_event_interned_data_index.h 中：

  // 不再包含外部头文件
  // #include "perfetto/tracing/event_context.h"  ❌

  // 直接在文件中定义
  namespace perfetto {
  class EventContext {
   public:
    EventContext() = default;
    ~EventContext() = default;
    internal::TrackEventIncrementalState* incremental_state_ = nullptr;
  };
  }

  当前 track_event_interned_data_index.h 的结构

  现在这个文件完全自包含，包含了所有需要的定义：

  1. ✅ Perfetto 宏定义（PERFETTO_DCHECK_IS_ON 等）
  2. ✅ 命名空间前向声明（protos::pbzero、protozero）
  3. ✅ BaseTrackEventInternedDataIndex 类
  4. ✅ TrackEventIncrementalState 结构体
  5. ✅ EventContext 类
  6. ✅ 标准库头文件（map、memory、utility 等）

  为什么这样有效？

  1. 零外部依赖：
    - 不依赖任何 Perfetto 头文件
    - 所有定义都在同一个文件中
    - 编译器不需要搜索其他文件
  2. 避免构建系统问题：
    - 不受 GitHub Actions 缓存影响
    - 不受头文件搜索路径影响
    - 不受文件系统同步问题影响
  3. 最小化实现：
    - 只定义必要的接口
    - 所有方法都是空操作
    - 编译器会优化掉这些代码

  编译进度

  我们已经到达 1386/4772 (约29%)，正在稳步推进。

  现在让我们等待 GitHub Actions 的编译结果！这次应该能通过了，因为文件完全自包含！🚀
